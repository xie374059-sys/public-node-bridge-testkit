# Release Notes

## v0.2.0-dev

- Added `run_node_c_preflight.py` for a safe Node-C local adapter preflight.
- Added `node_bridge_testkit.node_adapter`, which only handles `reply_exactly`
  and denies shell execution, file access, external sends, and private routing.
- Added CI coverage and a GitHub issue template for Node-C preflight results.
- Updated package version to `0.2.0.dev0`.

## v0.3.0-dev

- Added `install_node_c_avatar.py` and `run_node_c_avatar.py`.
- Added local-only `.node_c_avatar/` config and state generation.
- Added structured health, heartbeat, capabilities, boundary, and light-task
  result output.
- Added CI coverage for the installer preflight.

## Verified Locally

Expected claim:

```text
local_public_testkit_l0_l1_passed
```

Expected L0 result:

```text
OK
```

Expected L1 result:

```text
STATUS=READ_OK; MARKER=PUBLIC_L1; NEXT=SMALL_TASK
```

## Claim Boundary

This release proves:

```text
local relay + mock node + L0/L1 light task protocol can run on a user's machine
```

This release does not prove:

```text
real Codex Desktop IPC
real external node connection
formal ACK
external message sending
file execution
long-running autonomy
Yuanjie core open source
```

## Requirements

```text
Python 3.10+
No third-party Python packages
```

## Safety

V0.1 does not run shell commands, open private files, send external messages,
install packages, or connect to Yuanjie private infrastructure.
